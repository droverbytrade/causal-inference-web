## Requirements and grading

In case of successful course completion you’re awarded 9 credit points. Please be aware that course completion requires a substantial time investment outside class. This includes required readings, exercises and practical labs. I highly recommend to regularly get together in small groups to discuss course contents and also to prepare comments and questions to be discussed in class.

Methodological prerequisites for the course include basic familiarity with linear regression, statistical inference (e.g., confidence intervals, standard errors) and concepts like variables, levels of measurement, and distributions. Knowing some Stata won’t hurt, but isn’t necessary. For the course, working with Stata mostly consists of adapting existing code files with relevant commands to your purposes.

The final grade is based on a 60-minute exam written in the last week of the course. The exam assesses your progress in achieving the learning goals outlined above. It includes tasks that directly test your knowledge of the material and others that test its practical application. You can achieve a maximum of 60 points in the exam. A minimum of 30 points is required for a passing grade. I will distribute a mock exam later in the semester. By completing three Stata labs you can earn up to 30 bonus points for the final grade. For each lab, you can earn 10 points maximum. Labs are completed through submission on Ilias until a specic deadline. It is allowed (even encouraged!) to work on labs in pairs or small groups. Nonetheless, each of you must submit your own work in the end. Identical submissions are awarded 0 points in each case.

*Please note: Always check your submissions carefully with regard to spelling, grammar, and formatting (particularly ensuring that `Stata` output is readable). Bonus points are only counted until you reach the maximum number of 60 points in combination with the exam.*

The final grade is awarded according to the following rules:


|  Grade |    Points    |
|:-------|:-------------|
|   1.0  | 60 ≥ P ≤ 58  |
|   1.3  | 58 > P ≤ 55  |
|   1.7  | 55 > P ≤ 51  |
|   2.0  | 51 > P ≤ 48  |
|   2.3  | 48 > P ≤ 45  |
|   2.7  | 45 > P ≤ 42  |
|   3.0  | 42 > P ≤ 39  |
|   3.3  | 39 > P ≤ 36  |
|   3.7  | 36 > P ≤ 33  |
|   4.0  | 33 > P ≤ 30  |
|   n.p  | 30 > P ≤ 0   |
