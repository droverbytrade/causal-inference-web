## Goals and learning outcomes

The course has three broad goals, which I enumerate below. Each goal is associated with a number of specific learning outcomes, which you should be able to perform as the course concludes. Students who complete the course should be able to

1. formalize a research question about causal relations using causal graphs and counterfactuals. This includes
   * translating theoretical arguments about causal relations into a corresponding graphical model,
   * specifying the causal relation of interest and defining this relation in terms of counterfactual contrasts,
   * being able to conceptually distinguish this causal relation from statistical association.
   
2. use graphical models to devise strategies for identifying the causal relation of interest. For this, students
   * demonstrate that they are capable to derive empirical implications from a graphical causal model,
   * understand the theoretical assumptions necessary to test these implications,
   * critically evaluate whether these assumptions hold in applied social research.
   
3. estimate the causal relation of interest and, if feasible, test underlying assumptions. To do so, students
   * adapt existing Stata code for their purposes,
   * correctly interpret the resulting estimates,
   * understand and perform tests of the validity of the analyses.
   
As a bonus, I hope the course leads you to appreciate the opportunities offered by recent advances in the theory and tools for causal inference. The course, by far, doesnâ€™t cover everything there is. But it should provide you with enough understanding to learn more on your own.
