The class, for the most part, builds on the following three references, which---in the course schedule below---will be abbreviated as ELW, HR and PGJ, respectively:

* Elwert, F. (2013). [Graphical causal models.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6094-3_13) In: *Handbook of Causal Analysis for Social Research.* Ed. by Morgan, S. L. New York: Springer, pp. 245–272. = ELW
* Hernán, M. A. & Robins, J. M. (2018). [*Causal Inference*]( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Boca Raton, FL: Chapman & Hall/CRC, forthcoming. = HR.
* Pearl, J., Glymour, M., & Jewell, N. P. (2016). *Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer.* West Sussex, UK: Wiley = PGJ.

**Data and correlations (Oct 10 & 15)**  
Key point: *Correlations describe group differences in the data (whereas causal effects capture changes in the world)!*  
Required reading: PGJ, Preface + HR, Preface to Ch. 1 + [Shalizi (2018)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf), Ch. 1.1  
Further reading: PGJ, Ch. 1.3 (before 1.3.10) + [Shalizi (2018)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf), Ch. 1.2   
Assignment 2 (due Oct 15, 9:59am)

**Modelling correlations (Oct 17 & 22)**  
Key point: *Statistical models (like regression) interpolate and extrapolate correlations in sparse data (but don't estimate causal effects)!*  
Required reading: HR, Ch. 11  
Further reading: PGJ, Ch. 1.3.10 + 1.3.11 + [Shalizi (2018)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf), Ch. 1.3-1.5 + 11  
Assignment 3 (due Oct 22, 9:59am)  

**The limits of correlations (Oct 24 & 29)**  
Key point: *Data, correlations, and statistical models alone are not sufficient for causal inference (we also need causal models)!*  
Required reading: [Shalizi (2018)](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf), Ch. 2.4 + PGJ, pp. 1-6

Assignment 4 (due Oct 29, 9:59am)

**Building causal models (Oct 31 & Nov 5)**  
Key point: *Causal models are theories/assumptions about the common causes of our phenomena of interest!*  
Required reading: ELW, pp. 245-249  
Further reading: PGJ Ch. 1.4 + 1.5  
Assignment 5 (due Nov 5, 9:59am)

**From causal models to correlations (Nov 7 & 12)**  
Key point: *Causal models imply a set of correlations we should see in data (but the same set of correlations is consistent with multiple causal models)!*  
Required reading: ELW, pp. 249-254

Assignment 6 (due Nov 12, 9:59am)

**Defining and identifying total effects (Nov 14 & 19)**  
Key point: *Causal inference addresses what-if questions by separating causal correlations from noncausal correlations on the basis of causal models (which is often very tricky and sometimes impossible)!*  
Required reading: HR Ch. 1 + 3 + 6.4 + 4.1 + 4.3 + 6.6  
Further reading: ELW, pp. 254-261 + PGJ Ch. 3 + 4
